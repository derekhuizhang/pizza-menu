			Greek-Canadian Sam Panopoulos claimed that he created the first 
			Hawaiian pizza at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario, 
			Canada in 1962. Inspired in part by his experience preparing Chinese
			dishes which commonly mix sweet and savoury flavours, Panopoulos 
			experimented with adding pineapple, ham, bacon and other toppings
			which were not initially very popular. The addition of pineapple 
			to the traditional mix of tomato sauce and cheese, sometimes with 
			ham or sometimes with bacon, soon became popular locally and eventually 
			became a staple offering of pizzerias around the world. (Source: Wikipedia)
